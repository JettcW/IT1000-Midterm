# School

I started school when I was **six years old**. My parents started all their kids in school when they were six instead of five.
By the time I was in 8th grade the last year of middle school I already had my drivers permit and toward the end of my freshman year
in high school I had my drivers license.   
  
I attended [Rock Bridge High School](https://www.cpsk12.org/RBHS), In my junior year we went 100% online because of the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1).
This went on through my senior year. After graduation I did two semesters at MACC [(Moberly Area Community College)](https://www.macc.edu/). 
After that is when I transfered to the University of Missouri to study film production later changing my major to Information Technology.
